# What is 'Tower of Hanoi'?
The 'Tower of Hanoi' is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

# How to use the method?
This program is made in Java and is for Java programs.
You can use this method for your own programs, you don't need to ask me :)

The method has 3 parameters: number of rings, pole num. 1, pole num. 2, pole num. 3
Use 'hanoi(n,a,b,c)' to start the cycle.

e.g. 	
hanoi(4,1,2,3)
//This part goes in the main void

Output: 

Move disc 1 from pole 1 to pole 2 

Move disc 2 from pole 1 to pole 3 

Move disc 1 from pole 2 to pole 3 

Move disc 3 from pole 1 to pole 2 

Move disc 1 from pole 3 to pole 1 

Move disc 2 from pole 3 to pole 2 

Move disc 1 from pole 1 to pole 2 

Move disc 4 from pole 1 to pole 3 

Move disc 1 from pole 2 to pole 3 

Move disc 2 from pole 2 to pole 1 

Move disc 1 from pole 3 to pole 1 

Move disc 3 from pole 2 to pole 3 

Move disc 1 from pole 1 to pole 2 

Move disc 2 from pole 1 to pole 3 

Move disc 1 from pole 2 to pole 3
